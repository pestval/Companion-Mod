#  .gitignore — Files Git should NOT track
# ============================================================
#  Without this, Git would try to upload compiled binaries,
#  Visual Studio cache files, and other generated junk.
#  Your repo should only contain SOURCE CODE — things you
#  wrote by hand. Everything else can be regenerated.
# ============================================================

# --- Visual Studio build output ---
# These folders contain compiled .dll, .asi, .obj, .pdb files.
# They get regenerated every time you hit Build.
